# Turtle Up Edutainment Game

## Overview  
**Turtle Up** is an edutainment game developed for the Turtle Up recycling center in Kokrobite, Ghana. The game is designed to raise awareness about sea turtle conservation through interactive gameplay, combining education and entertainment. Players experience both human and turtle perspectives, learning about the impact of pollution on marine life and the importance of proper waste disposal.

---

## Features

### Two Gameplay Perspectives:
- **Human (Level 1):** Collect and sort trash, navigate obstacles, and help maintain a clean beach environment. Properly dispose of items using a drag-and-drop inventory system and color-coded bins.
- **Turtle (Level 2):** Scavenge for food while avoiding plastic waste, illustrating the challenges sea turtles face in polluted waters.

### Character Customization:
Players can select from five native turtle species and a variety of human avatars, reflecting the biodiversity of Ghana and allowing for representation and player choice.

### Inventory System:
Tracks collected trash and allows for proper disposal at designated bins. Improper sorting will eventually trigger feedback to help guide player learning *(in progress)*.

### Educational Integration:
Pop-up learning moments and visuals demonstrate conservation best practices. A tutorial sequence introduces objectives and controls for new players.

### Mobile Compatibility:
Click-to-move functionality ensures a smooth experience on touchscreen devices. WASD and double-click-to-run are also supported for desktop play.

### Immersive Design Elements:
Includes a day-night cycle, animated objects (fire pit, windmill, flowing stream), sound effects, and a mini-map to enhance gameplay and player engagement.

## üåê Deployment Notes

We are currently exploring how to make the game accessible through the [Turtle Up website](https://turtleup.org). Our goal is to ensure the game is playable on both desktop and mobile devices while keeping it secure and easy to update.

### Current Hosting Options:
- **GitHub Pages (WebGL Build):**  
  You can view the current WebGL build here:  
  [https://spearsz2.github.io/CPS491Group14self/](https://spearsz2.github.io/CPS491Group14self/)  
  This uses Unity‚Äôs built-in WebGL exporter and is hosted via GitHub Pages.

- **Turtle Up Website (iframe):**  
  We are in contact with the Turtle Up IT department (Mike) to assess the feasibility of embedding the game via iframe on the organization‚Äôs site.  
  - **Pros:** Safer and easier to maintain  
  - **Cons:** May cause issues with mobile compatibility  
  Further testing and collaboration is ongoing.

### Notes for Future Developers:
- WebGL builds must be placed in a `/Build` folder and linked to an `index.html`.
- Some Unity features may not work in WebGL (e.g., certain shaders or intensive physics).
- Use Unity‚Äôs compression and resolution settings to optimize for mobile.
- If not using iframe, take care to sandbox the game to avoid any potential conflicts with the hosting website.
