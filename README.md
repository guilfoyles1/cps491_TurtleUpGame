# Turtle Up Edutainment Game

## Overview  
**Turtle Up** is an edutainment game developed for the Turtle Up recycling center in Kokrobite, Ghana. The game is designed to raise awareness about sea turtle conservation through interactive gameplay, combining education and entertainment. Players experience both human and turtle perspectives, learning about the impact of pollution on marine life and the importance of proper waste disposal.

## Features

### Two Gameplay Perspectives:
- **Human (Level 1):** Collect and sort trash, navigate obstacles, and help maintain a clean beach environment. Properly dispose of items using a drag-and-drop inventory system and color-coded bins.
- **Turtle (Level 2):** Scavenge for food while avoiding plastic waste and fishing nets, illustrating the challenges sea turtles face in polluted waters. Developed by Team 1 using an underwater-themed asset pack and unique swimming mechanics.

### Character Customization:
Players can select from five native turtle species and a variety of human avatars, reflecting the biodiversity of Ghana and allowing for representation and player choice.

### Inventory System:
Tracks collected trash and allows for proper disposal at designated bins. Improper sorting triggers visual/audio feedback and affects scoring.

### Educational Integration:
Pop-up learning moments and visuals demonstrate conservation best practices. A tutorial sequence introduces objectives and controls for new players.

### Mobile Compatibility:
Click-to-move functionality ensures a smooth experience on touchscreen devices. WASD and double-click-to-run are also supported for desktop play.  
In Level 2, a **hold-to-move** mechanic was used to better reflect the turtle's swimming behavior.

### Immersive Design Elements:
Includes a day-night cycle, animated objects (fire pit, windmill, flowing stream), sound effects, and a mini-map to enhance gameplay and player engagement.

## üåê Deployment Notes

We are currently exploring how to make the game accessible through the [Turtle Up website](https://turtleup.org). Our goal is to ensure the game is playable on both desktop and mobile devices while keeping it secure and easy to update.

### Current Hosting Options:
- **GitHub Pages (WebGL Build):**  
https://guilfoyles1.github.io/cps491group14_homepage/

- **Turtle Up Website (iframe):**  
  Discussed and tested with Turtle Up‚Äôs IT contact. Iframe offers better safety, but testing is ongoing to ensure mobile usability.

### Notes for Future Developers:
- Place WebGL output in a `/Build` folder linked to `index.html`.
- Optimize with Unity‚Äôs resolution and compression settings for mobile.
- Avoid unsupported Unity features in WebGL exports.
