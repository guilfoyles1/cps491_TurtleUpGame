# Turtle Up Edutainment Game

## Overview
Turtle Up is an edutainment game developed for the Turtle Up recycling center in Kokrobite, Ghana.

  - **Turtle (Level 2):** Scavenge for food while avoiding plastic waste, illustrating the challenges sea turtles face.
- **Character Customization:** Players can select from five native turtle species and a variety of human avatars.
- **Inventory System:** Tracks collected trash and allows for proper disposal at designated bins.
